# Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection-OpenCV
A Computer Vision project that detects vehicle number plates using OpenCV and a pretrained Haarcascade Russian classifier. The system processes images, converts them to grayscale, and localizes license plates with bounding boxes. Demonstrates traditional object detection without deep learning models.
