# Vehicle Number Plate Detection using Haarcascade
### Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting vehicle number plates using Computer Vision techniques. It uses a pretrained Haarcascade Russian license plate detection model to localize number plates from vehicle images.

The system identifies the number plate region and highlights it with bounding boxes, demonstrating a complete object detection pipeline using traditional Computer Vision methods.

### Objectives

Detect vehicle number plates from images

Use pretrained Haarcascade model for localization

Build a clean Computer Vision workflow

Visualize detected plates with bounding boxes

### Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

Haarcascade (Russian Plate Model)

NumPy

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook
